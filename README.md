# AssemblyCalculus.jl

This is a library for simulating brain computation according to the
assembly calculus model proposed by
[Papadimitriou et. al..](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/25/14464)

Assembly calculus is built on the assumption that an object is represented 
in brain regions by a small number of active neurons in that region.
